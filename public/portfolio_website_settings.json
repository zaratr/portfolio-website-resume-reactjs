A few fun things I have self taught are building a Deep Reinforcement Learning Code to play agains a computer player and medium difficulty! Also, I built a Billy Bass the talking fish to speak using google voice/ Amazon Alexa! I enjoy making a good laugh with everyday things and very familiar with mechanical/electrical engineering. I have self taught myself a few back end languages and went to school for React, JavaScript!",
